# Surya Maddula — Physical-World Intelligence Infrastructure

## Creative Philosophy
One continuous narrative scroll. Every pixel signals: **"He's building physical-world intelligence infrastructure — starting with open-environment acoustic control for industrial and transit spaces."** Restraint is the signal. Specificity is the proof. Capital is catalytic for enterprise distribution.

## Design System
- **Theme**: Light + Dark toggle (minimal, floating top-right)
- **Typography**: Modern sans-serif (Inter or similar), large hero type, tight tracking, generous whitespace
- **Colors**: White/dark base, deep charcoal text, single restrained accent gradient — no bright colors
- **Depth**: 3-layer continuous parallax — foreground text, midground elements, background ambient motion
- **Navigation**: Near-invisible. Floating dot progress indicator. Scroll is primary.

## Flow — One Continuous Narrative

### 1. The Opening (0–4 seconds)
- Full-screen immersive. Soft gradient + subtle neural ambient motion (lightweight canvas, very faint)
- **Hero line:** *"Building physical-world intelligence infrastructure."* — large, quiet, centered
- **Subtext:** *"Built across hardware, ML, and distributed systems."* — small, surgical
- Breathing chevron. Staggered spring-eased text reveal.

### 2. The Signature Moment ✦ (5–8 seconds)
- Scroll past hero → headline **disintegrates into particles** (400–600ms, subliminal)
- Particles reform into the Orbit layout
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`. Disabled below 60fps / low-power devices.
- Pure CSS + lightweight canvas — no animation libraries

### 3. The Orbit — Focus Areas
- Architectural. Slow gravitational drift. No bouncing.
- **5 Nodes:** AI Infrastructure · Applied Systems · Venture Architecture · Long-Term Thinking · Writing
- Hover → restrained glow + one sharp sentence connecting to physical-world intelligence thesis
- Scroll → subtle depth parallax shift

### 4. Philosophy Interjection #1
- *"Infrastructure compounds."*

### 5. Selected Work — 5 Projects
- Narrative arc: Measurement → Hardware → Material Science → Product Strategy → System Redesign
  1. **Digital MRV** — *Satellite-to-soil verification system for carbon restoration.* · Shell
  2. **Open Air ANC** — *Open-environment noise cancellation system. Filed patent.* · Patent
  3. **Ecoligna** — *Transparent wood replacing glass. 70% energy reduction.* · TKS Moonshot
  4. **Future of Alexa** — *Gen Z product strategy for Amazon's voice platform.* · Amazon
  5. **Future of Banking** — *Redesigned CIBC for a generation that won't visit branches.* · CIBC
- Spring entrance with depth blur. Hover: lift + shadow. Click: smooth modal, no layout shift.

### 6. Philosophy Interjection #2
- *"Constraints create leverage."*

### 7. Trajectory Bridge
- *"The next system will be larger."* — large, centered, maximum whitespace

### 8. Writing — Contemplative Space
- Floating sentence fragments from Surya's writing
- Click → full-screen contemplative view + outbound link to Medium/Substack
- Background tone shifts quieter

### 9. What I'm Building Now — Live Signal (Leverage Core)
- Directional and honest — no fabricated claims:
  - **Now →** *Building open-environment acoustic control infrastructure*
  - *Targeting industrial and transit environments*
  - *Designing v2 system architecture*
  - *Partnering where alignment compounds.*
  - *Scaling deliberately.*
- Specific wedge is named. Direction is clear. No false pilot claims.
- Easy to update as real deployments materialize.

### 10. The Close
- **CTA line:** *"Built for long-term alignment."* — large, quiet, centered
- **me@suryamaddula.com** — elegant mailto with subtle hover animation
- **Footer icons:** LinkedIn, X, Instagram, Medium, Substack, Google Patents — icon row with hover glow
- **Scarcity signal (low contrast, small font):** *"Building deliberately. Access is selective."*
- Light/dark toggle

## Motion & Performance Rules
- All motion: restrained, subliminal, spring-based
- One signature moment only (particle disintegration)
- Continuous 3-layer parallax throughout
- `prefers-reduced-motion` fully respected
- Heavy effects disabled below 60fps / low-power devices
- Hero fonts preloaded. No heavy libraries. Pure CSS + lightweight canvas.
- Pre-calculated modal layouts for zero layout shift
- **Target: 90+ Lighthouse performance score**

---

## Tone & Copy Rules
- Conviction, not pitch. Autonomy, not hustle.
- **Wedge:** Open-environment acoustic control for industrial and transit spaces — specific, defensible, narrow enough to feel inevitable
- **Domain:** Physical-world intelligence infrastructure — the expansion path from the wedge
- Honest about current stage — directional language, not fabricated operational claims
- Scarcity discovered, not declared
- The site must cause: *"What's the specific wedge?"* → and the answer is already on the page.
